There are two scenes in the program, one with 1 light and one with 2 lights.

All objects in the scenes are reflective, with the two mirror spheres near the snow man to be completely reflective.

All rays leave the scene are colored light blue which is the background color

some spots on the ground are blue because the color of the sphere is reflected on the plane.

The glass sphere is place at the left side of the scene.

The camera isn't changed.
